- Begin with creating skeleton of files (html, js, css)
- Start sketching out the design in freeform
    - Need:
        - title
        - the game board
        - score 
        - buttons to start and play again

- Maybe play with the colors, I like things more sleek in general
- Began implementing html/css to achieve the freeform design
    - As always, ideas came to me while implementing.
- Create the gameboard via grid and use the background of the grid to be the actual board axes
